Can the defiled be consecrated? Can the fallen find rest?
We fall so that we may learn to pick ourselves up once again.
In the end, every plan relies upon a strong arm, and tempered steel. 	
As the fiend falls, a faint hope blossoms.
Their formation is broken - maintain the offensive. 
Monstrous size has no intrinsic merit, unless inordinate exsanguination be considered a virtue.
Madness, our old friend!
Frustration and fury, more destructive than a hundred cannons.
